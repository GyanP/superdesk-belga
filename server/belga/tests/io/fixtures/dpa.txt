Top EU court: Britain can unilaterally reverse Brexit decision
By Helen Maguire, dpa  =
 
Luxembourg (dpa) - Britain could unilaterally decide not to leave the
European Union, the bloc's top court ruled on Monday, one day before
British lawmakers are due to vote on the Brexit deal London has
struck with Brussels.

British politicians campaigning for a second referendum on Brexit
hailed the ruling as a boost for their cause, while some commentators
said it could help Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May in her bid
to scare rebel lawmakers away from voting against her deal.

The decision to reverse Brexit would be a "sovereign" choice, the
European Court of Justice (ECJ) argued. Subjecting it to the approval
of other member states could end up forcing Britain to leave "against
its will," the court said in a statement.

British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt dismissed the ruling, but
co-litigant Alyn Smith, a Scottish National Party (SNP) member of the
European Parliament, hailed it as a "huge win."

"I think it's irrelevant because just imagine how the 52 per cent of
the country who voted for Brexit would feel if any British government
were to delay leaving the EU on March 29," Hunt told reporters in
Brussels.

"I think people would be shocked and very angry and it's certainly
not the intention of the government," Hunt said.

Smith said taking the case to the ECJ had "worked better than [the
SNP] could have hoped for."

"A bright light has switched on above an exit sign," he said.

Joanna Cherry, an SNP member of the British parliament, said she was
pleased that the ECJ had "provided this lifeline to the UK parliament
at this moment of crisis."

Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake, who helped bring the
case, said the ruling enabled the government to prevent a "chaotic
no-deal" Brexit and helped bring the possibility of a second
referendum "closer than ever."

The petitioners, who initially brought the case before the Scottish
courts, had asked whether Britain can reverse its decision to trigger
the Brexit countdown, arguing that lawmakers should be aware of all
options when they cast their Brexit votes.

Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, two years after May
invoked Article 50 of the EU treaty, triggering the countdown.

May's government had sought to have the case dismissed, arguing that
the question is purely hypothetical since it has no intention of
reversing Brexit.

But the Luxembourg-based judges rejected that argument.

The ruling is broadly in line with the recommendations of Advocate
General Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona, a top advisor to the court.

It could, however, open the way for disgruntled member states to
trigger Article 50 in future, in the hope of negotiating better
membership terms.

The British parliament is due to vote on Tuesday on the withdrawal
agreement and a political declaration outlining joint ambitions for
the future relationship between Britain and the EU.

May has faced an uphill struggle to sell the deal to parliament.
Hardline eurosceptics fear that it binds Britain too closely to the
EU, while those in favour of a softer Brexit say it goes too far.
